## Description: 
This code represents the implementation of our methodology for preprocessing the Genomic DB and make the respective analyses. 
With this code, we generated the images and results of the manuscript [1] submitted on Infection and available at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2285898/v1. 

# Structure of the code (Pseudocode): 
Manipulation of .fasta files: (bash commands)
1) Importing dataset
2) Linearize fasta file with multiple sequences
3) Remove those with incomplete collection date
4) Create of a comparison table with ATCG contents using [2] [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk)
5) Determine quality of sequences (those with N % < 10)
6) Extract all high-quality sequences 
7) Compute a sequence alignment using [3] [MAFFT](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/30/4/772/1073398) application 
8) Linearize MAFFT output fasta file
9) Calling [4][R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts for data engineering 
 * preFilter_raw_metatable.R
 * Filter_preTable.R
 * Analyze_MexSARS_indels.R
10) Create longidutinal pdfs with [5] [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/t/pdftk/)
11) Finally get the consensus per variant in each category
 * Mutations_table.R
 * Get_consensus.R
 * Get_mutations.R	

## Table of Contents:
This repository contains different types of formats. We have different Scripts 
and xlsx files which contain data until 7th November
- The /bash/main_commands.sh file: contains the general pipeline followed in this work
- The /code/preFilter_raw_metatable.R File: apply data cleaning and preprocessing
- The /code/Filter_preTable.R file: contains data engineering process
- The /code/Analyze_MexSARS_indels.R file: creates a table to analyze nt mutations (substitutions) per positions using a linearized fasta file
- The /code/Mutations_table.R file: explore all the alignments and creates table comparing of every genome by position
- The /code/Get_consensus.R file: parse a table containing SARS-CoV-2 nt positions as rows and each nucleotide (including gaps and Ns)
- The /code/Get_mutations.R file: parse a table containing SARS-CoV-2 nt positions as rows and each nucleotide (including gaps and Ns) creates a 
summary table of all  possible observed mutations per position
## How to run the scripts

To run our code:
- Download the full content of the directory containing this README file.
- Make sure you have installed R (we developed the code under version: R.4.2.2 (Innocent and Trusting; released on 2022-10-31), so we suggest this or subsequent versions). 
Also, please verify the corresponding programs / dependencies mention in the section below

We used the following version of the programs/libraries :
- MAFFT v.7.0.5
- Seqtk-1.3 (r106)
- See Credits for other programs mention before
